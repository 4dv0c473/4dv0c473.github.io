    Hackers, punks, mavericks — whatever — burn your LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn
    is not the place to find an organization where you can make meaningful code
    contributions in exchange for a living wage. LinkedIn is where they slowly change
    our minds about business. LinkedIn is where you find opportunities to spend
    your days in meetings being told how to design somebody else's dream
    software. Don't be fooled. They've wrapped the hacker ethos in millennial
    pink and expect us to jump on board at the first sign of free kombucha.
    Hackers — the old internet is still out there. Dig deep. Like
    <a href="https://thevinylfactory.com/features/crate-digging-dont-do-it-stefan-glerum-comic/">crate diggers</a>
    deep. Hold fast to your ethos and your values. Your community is out there.
